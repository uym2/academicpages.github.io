I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). 
I am working with [Prof. Siavash Mirarab](http://eceweb.ucsd.edu/~smirarab/) on computational biology, with the focus on evolutionary biology.
I am interested in developing computational methods that handle large-scale datasets and software tools that are useful for biologists. 
In addition, I am interested in data analysis of large-scale phylogenomics, especially microbiology and viruses.
I am a contributor (a co-first author) to the [WoL: Reference Phylogeny for Microbes](https://biocore.github.io/wol/), which indluces 10,575 genomes of bacteria and archaea on 381 global marker genes. I was a recipient of the Microbial Sciences Graduate Research Fellowship in 2017 and 2018.
I obtained the MS degree at UCSD in 2019 and BS degree (summa cum laude) at Portland State University in 2016.
