I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). 
I am working with [Prof. Siavash Mirarab](http://eceweb.ucsd.edu/~smirarab/) on computational biology, with the focus on evolutionary biology.
I develop computational methods that are scalable to large biological datasets. 
Below are the software packages I have developed:
* [MinVar rooting](https://github.com/uym2/MinVar-Rooting): rooting a phylogenetic tree by minimizing root-to-tip variance
* [TreeShrink](https://github.com/uym2/treeshrink): detecting abnormaly long branches in phylogenetic trees by diameter analysis
* [wLogDate](https://github.com/uym2/wLogDate): computing time tree from an inferred phylogram by minimizing a logarithmic penalty function

In addition, I am also interested in data analysis of phylogenomics data, especially microbiology and viruses.
I am a contributor (co-first author) to the [WoL: Reference Phylogeny for Microbes](https://biocore.github.io/wol/), which includes 10,575 bacterial and archaeal genomes on 381 global marker genes. I was a recipient of the Microbial Sciences Graduate Research Fellowship in 2017 and 2018.
I obtained the MS degree at UCSD in 2019 and BS degree at Portland State University in 2016.
